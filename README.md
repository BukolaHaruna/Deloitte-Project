# Deloitte Project
This Project includes two tasks.
Task 1: Identify the location where machines broke down the most and determine which specific machines had the highest failure rates in that location.

Task 2: Create a new column labeled "Equality Class" that categorises equality scores into three types:
  Fair (scores between -10 and +10),
  Unfair (scores less than -10 or greater than 10),
  Highly Discriminative (scores less than -20 or greater than 20).
